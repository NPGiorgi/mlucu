    "After taking a look at the chart and the matrix, we can find a correlation between `fare` and `pclass` (around 0.5), between `body` and `survived` and . That tells us that we should remove one of those. The more representative one is `pclass` which tell us in which class the passenger was traveling, so let's keep that one and remove `fare`. We also see high correlations among `survived`, `body` and `boat`, so we will remove those as well."
